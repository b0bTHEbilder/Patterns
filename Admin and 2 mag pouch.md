These are the templates for all the pieces needed to make the admin and 2 mag pouch. 
Solid lines show edges, dash-lines show sewing lines and dash-dot-lines show where fabric is folded.

--FRONT PANEL--

If you want molle on your front panel you should make two of these, one in your preferred camo fabric and one in a fabric you're not afraid to spend. They essentially become one piece and going forward will be treated as such.

--MIDDLE WALL--

This piece is the middle wall and inner lining as they are the same size. If you want to put velcro/elastic organization inside I'd suggest not using thin lining fabric but cordura.

The velcro is for the piece that is the admin pouches outer wall towards the mag pouches.

--MAG SLEEVE--

--BACK MOLLE--

To cut the back molle basically do the same thing as with the front panel but instead of having two pieces of fabric put ontop of each other you have one piece of fabric folded. Then when it comes time to sew it onto the mag sleeve I like to put the edge with the fold on the bottom, because it's a cleaner edge and the upper edge will be covered wth molle anyway.

--ZIPPER--

--BOTTOM and SEPARATOR-- 

The bottom is just sewn onto the ends of the zipper, the ends are then edge binded. The separator is not sewn on it's own, the sewing lines show where it's sewn onto the MAG SLEEVE and MIDDLE WALL right in between the velcro panels and at the same height as them.
