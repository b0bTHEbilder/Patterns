SPUD pouch  
A simple all purpose pouch, that can hold up to 3 AR/AK mags and anything else you desire.  

--MAIN BODY--  
The main body of the pouch can be made from a single piece, or if you're low on camo fabric/want the inside to be a different colour for aesthetic reasons You can make it from two separate pieces.  
-SINGLE PIECE-

--MAKING PROCESS-- 
If you make the main body from two pieces then sew them together by the top sew line such that both pieces right sides are facing each other. Then fold them out along the stitch line and about 2-5mm from the edge sew them again, that preserves the shape of the pouch better and makes it not fold in on itself. If you make the body from a single piece just fold it in half along the dash-dot line and do the 2-5mm stitch along the folded side.

Then you can sew on the velcro. Make sure that the two layers of fabric are alligned, secure them with double-sided tape, clips or sewing pins. I prefer tape because when smartly placed it gets close to where you want to sew but doesn't get in the way of your sewing machines foot. Sew the velcro as shown below, note that for the upper velcro it's important that there is a reasonable gap between the stitches you made to keep the fabric folded (light blue).

Here keep in mind that since you folded the fabric and "lost" 1cm off the top the velcro sits about 20mm from the top not the shown 30.
