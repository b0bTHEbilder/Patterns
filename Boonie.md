Boonie hat fabric templates.
All measurements are in mm.
This hat is for head circumfrences 57-60cm. I myself am 60cm and this leaves just enought room to fit a finger inbetween.
The paracord helps a lot when the hat is too big. For image references look up the Uf Pro Striker Gen 2 Boonie.

Solid line is edge, dash line is sewing line, dash dot line is symmetry.


--BRIM--
Two pieces of the brim are needed, they are sewn together with the non-camo sides facing outward and then turned inside out. An optional thin foam sheet can be inserted, it's measurements are roughly the same as the boonies sewin line measurements. If you want to insert a foam sheet I'd suggest after sewing the pieces together to trim the outer excess material to about 4mm from the thread. For the circular lines around the brim I just took the width of my sewing machine foot and spiraled inward from the outer perimeter. Before finishing the first loop I added two pieces of ~14cm long wire for the front and back.

This is how to make a paper template for the boonies wall. First cut out two of the rectangles and three of the arcs. Then cut up two of the arcs into pieces as shown and assemble all pieces as below.

--INSIDE SPACER THINGY--  
I made it from a heavy mesh material from Tacticaltrim, but it doesn't breathe well when folded so I'm looking into the Coolmax Fresh Fabric from Shelbyoutdoors.
