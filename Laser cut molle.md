To achieve the "laser cut" effect without a laser cutter I used a soldering iron. Doesn't need to be a fancy one, I got mine on aliexpress for 20 dollars or so. Later I bought a fine tip for it. 
You'll also need a metal ruler and a non-flamable baseplate, I used a glass panel.
Soldering Iron is set to 450C as that is the highest it will go and about 420C is the temperature that my cordura starts to melt. 
Make sure you're in a well-ventilated room because the burning plastic fumes stink a bit and probably aren't good for you.

For cuts that only require one clean edge I used the techneaque in the top image, the left part of fabric will get a nice smooth edge as all the molten plastic will squeese to the left. If I'm cutting molle slots I use the bottom one because it keeps both deformations to a minimum.

(light gray is the ruler, blueish gray is the soldering iron's tip and green is the fabric I'm cutting)
