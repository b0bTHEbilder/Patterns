# INTRODUCTION

A friend recently asked me to make a pouch similar to the Ferro Concepts Roll 1 Trauma Pouch (https://ferroconcepts.com/products/roll-1-trauma-pouch). Here are my sewing patterns and some instructions. Have fun!

# SLEEVE
## Parts list

- 1x 220x270mm Cordura (Body)
- 2x 60x270mm Cordura (End)
- 1x 220x270mm Light fabric (Lining)
- 1x 50x200mm Velcro hook
- 1x 50x200mm Velcro loop
- 2x ~300mm Paracord
- 2x Cord lock

(The lining is ideally a thin, low friction fabric, but the inside of some Corduras is fine too, it's just to make pulling out the insert easier)

## Patterns

For the two End pieces fold the shorter edges in (dash-dot line) and sew at about 5mm from the edge, this distance doesnt really matter, it's just to hide the raw edge. You should now have two 60x250mm pieces. These will be sandwitched between the Body and Lining as shown below, with the wrong sides out. The ends are alligned with the 270mm edges of the Lining and Body staying 10mm short from the edges on both sides.

Turn the big piece inside out and fold it in half so the edges without the Ends touch. Alling them and sew them together about 5mm from the edge, this is just to reinforce them and to help keep them together for when you sew the Velcro, since you sew the Velcro 10mm from the edge the 5mm stitch will be covered either way.

I attachced the velcro panels to each other with thin double sided tape and alligned them so that the Velcro would end where the folded and sewn edged of the Ends start. 

Now push the paracord through the Ends, add the cord locks and tie them up. Getting the paracor through the ends is quite fiddly, I eventually made a wire hook for myself to pull the cord through. 

That's pretty much it for the Sleeve.

# INSERT
## Parts list
- 1x 250x400mm Cordura (Body)
- 1x 200x210mm Cordura (Sleeve)
- 1x 25x40mm Molle
- 2x 25x100 Velcro loop
- 1x 25x50mm Velcro loop
- 1x 25x100m Velcro hook
- 1x 50x200mm Velcro hook
- 2x 25x210mm Elastic webbing

(If possible use a less stiff elastic webbing, mine is from tacticaltrim.de and while it does the job, I'd prefer it be a bit more stretchy/soft)
