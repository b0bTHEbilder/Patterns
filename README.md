Sewing patterns for MYOG tactical gear

Hi! Here I'll be posting my progress on making tactical gear.
For more pictures check out my Reddit: u/b0bTHEbild3r or my Instagram: @b0b_the_bild3r.
As this is a work in progress and I have no idea what I'm doing if you have any questions about anything I've posted message me on Reddit or Instagram.
